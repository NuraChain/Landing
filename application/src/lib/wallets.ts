// The wallets this site talks to, and deliberately no others.
//
// Discovery is EIP-6963 rather than `window.ethereum`, and that is not a modernisation - it is
// what makes a roster possible at all. The injected global carries no identity: two extensions
// installed side by side overwrite each other on it, and `isMetaMask` is set by half a dozen
// wallets that are not MetaMask. An announcement carries an `rdns`, so a wallet can be named.
//
// The roster is a GATE here, unlike the advisory lists most sites keep: a wallet that is not on
// it is not offered, because that is what this deployment asked for. The cost is real and worth
// writing down - someone whose only wallet is Rabby or OKX has to add the network by hand from
// the values in the chain card, and EIP-6963 exists precisely to end lists like this one.
// Widening it is one entry below and no change anywhere else.
